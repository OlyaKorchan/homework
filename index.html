    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <p>
        <br> - 90g softened unsalted butter, plus a little extra for greasing the rings
        <br> - 90g dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids), finely chopped
        <br> - 2 medium eggs
        <br> - 2 medium egg yolks

    </p>

    <h3> Method </h3>
    <p> 1. Pre-heat the oven to 180Â°C/gas mark 4 </p>
    <p> 2. Butter the inside of the metal rings, and line each one with non-stick baking parchment to come just above the top. Stand them on a parchment-lined baking tray </p>
    <p> 3. Melt the chocolate very gently in a bowl over a pan of hot water. Add the butter and stir until thoroughly mixed </p>
    <p> 4. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, egg yolks and sugar until evenly combined. Mix in the melted chocolate, and gently fold in the flour. Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes </p>
    <p> 5. Spoon the mixture into the parchment-lined rings, until they are about two thirds full. Chill them in the fridge for at least an hour (they will keep for up to 6 hours) </p>
    <p> 6. To bake the fondants, place the tray in the centre of the oven and cook for 10 minutes. Let them rest for 2 minutes before carefully lifting away the metal rings and parchment. Transfer them to small serving plates and serve with vanilla ice cream
